        <h1>Problems with our waterways</h1>
        <p>Many people think of water being polluted by a big spill from a factory or accident because it is very noticeable. However, other sources of water pollution are just as bad as big spills. These can include runoff from farmland and leaking septic tanks, which can be harder to trace. These can all add up to a significant pollution source.</p>
        <p>Farming in Northland has been a major source of water pollution. Past farming practices used to let the dirty cowshed effluent go straight into streams and rivers. Now, however, farmers are required to collect the cowshed effluent into ponds. Natural bacteria in the ponds break down the effluent in the water. Farmers are being encouraged to spray this waste water on to paddocks as a good fertiliser.</p>
        <p>Cities and towns create water pollution in many ways. All the roadsides have kerbing which channels water into stormwater drains. These all lead into streams and harbours.</p>
        <p>Washing cars on the driveway at home means the suds will be washed into the stormwater system. Biodegradable washing liquid still pollutes the water for a time because it uses oxygen in the water when it is breaking down. This means there is less oxygen for the fish and plants in the stream to use. It is better to wash the car on the lawn so that the grass can act as a filter.</p>
        <p>People in towns sometimes pour paint or engine oil down drains, forgetting that these pollutants will end up in rivers and streams, which run out to the sea. Everything that is put down a drain eventually reaches waterways, so remember the saying: "Drains should only drain rain."</p>
        <p>Water in the ground collects in underwater lakes called aquifers. Many people in rural areas get their drinking water from these water sources through wells and bores. Ground water can be contaminated by pollution leaching through the soil. Farmers are encouraged to manage amounts of potential contaminants applied to the land and to keep bore holes sealed so nothing can drop down into the underground water supply.</p>
        <h1>Health concerns with our waterways</h1>
        <p>A freshwater scientist has raised concerns about he level of bacteria found in some of New Zealand's waterways, including some of the Western Bay of Plenty's favourite recreational spots.
        <br>
        A study by the National Institute of Water and Atmosphere (Niwa) analysed 928 spots throughout New Zealand tested between 2009 and 2013. It showed which urban sites exceeded the minimum acceptable state for "primary contact" like swimming, as set out by the Government's National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management.</p>
        <h1>What is Fresh Water?</h1>
        <p>Freshwater refers to water from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, underground streams, and other sources. Water is continually evaporated from the oceans and then returned to the land as ice, snow, or rain. Ice and snow melt from mountains to release freshwater to our rivers, streams, lakes, and to resupply underground streams.
        <br>
        New Zealand's freshwater habitats range from glaciers and seepages in the mountains, down to lowland rivers and streams that flow into estuaries. They include lakes, rivers, streams, some wetlands, cave systems, geothermal areas and underground aquifers.</p>
        <h1>Importance of Freshwater Habitats</h1>
        <p>Freshwater ecosystems contribute to biodiversity, the economy, recreational opportunities, cultural significance and our well-being.
        <br>
        Freshwater is used by a wide variety of native plants and animals. Some of these are unique to New Zealand and often highly specialised to the habitats they are found in.
        <br>
        Tangata whenua have strong links to water. Awa (river) are an important part of whakapapa (geneaology) and freshwater sustains taniwha and protects wƒÅhi tapu (sacred areas). Awa also provide valuable resources such as mahinga kai (harvesting), harakeke (flax) and habitat for species of cultural importance (e.g. tuna/eels).</p>
        <h1>Threats and Pressures</h1>
        <p>Our freshwater ecosystems are impacted by a number of pressures. These include land use change and intensification, deforestation, drainage, reduced flows, pollution, sedimentation, nutrient enrichment and spread of invasive species.
        <br>
        These pressures have had significant consequences for our freshwater species, which are vulnerable to habitat loss and degradation, competition and predation from invasive species, overharvest and interbreeding.</p>
