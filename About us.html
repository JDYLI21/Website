        <h1>About us...</h1>
        <p>We were first introduced to waterways problems in New Zealand back in 1996, when we found out a lot of New Zealand's waterways, particularly the ones in Auckland, are in very bad shape. 62% of the rivers and lakes in Auckland are graded as poor by the Ministry for the Environment for swimming, as well as having no rivers graded as good.</p>
        <p>We plan on stopping this, and restore New Zealand's pride as a clean and safe country whom one has freedom to do whatever they want, anywhere they want, safely.</p>
        <p>We hope you join us on our journey.</p>
